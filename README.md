# PyTorch Training Pipeline â€“ Breast Cancer Detection

This project implements a **PyTorch-based machine learning pipeline** for binary classification on the [Breast Cancer dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gscdit/Breast-Cancer-Detection/refs/heads/master/data.csv).  
It demonstrates the **end-to-end workflow** of a deep learning model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
